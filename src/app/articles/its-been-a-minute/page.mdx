I don't consider myself a thought leader. I much prefer doing things than
writing about doing things, and I'm loath to offer any advice without understanding
someone's particular circumstance. I try to live by the rules to not
offer any advice unless asked, and never give advice with the assumption that
it will be taken.

Aside from making the occasional snarky remarks on LinkedIn, I've been relatively
quite on social media and the Internet in general over the past few years.

Times have changed, however, and one must change with the times. So I'll be
hopefully posting some new content here documenting what I'm up to, what I'm
learning, and any stories that come to mind.
