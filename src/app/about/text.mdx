When I was young, my dad brought home a Texas Instruments TI-99/4A,
an early personal computer.
My brothers and I mostly used it to play games, waiting for what
seemed like eons for games to load off of a cassette tape. The computer
also had a BASIC interpreter, and I learned my first computer program:

```
10 PRINT HELLO
20 GOTO 10
```

My family had a computer in high school as well, an IBM PS/2. Like
the one before it, this was also used to play games. I developed
a healthy addiction to the game Civilization which continues to this day.
Before the Web, I used it to connect to Prodigy and make friends
across the country, as well as learn a scripting language.

It was fun, but wasn't my passion.
When I went to college, my first major was Philosophy.
I wanted to be a writer.
It was by happenstance my dorm was full of engineers, and
I learned I knew as much, if not more, about computers and
programming as the incoming computer science majors.

I never thought computers could be something I
could do as a job. My generation was the first of my family to go to
college, and like the old saying goes:
if you can't see it, you can't be it.

At university, I found "my people." I had found a new passion
in writing code. It was creating. It was solving problems.
I was hooked.

Fast-forward to today and I've spent my entire adult life as a
software engineer and development team leader. In that time I've
worked for Fortune 500 companies and two-person startups.
I've written kernel C code for cell phones, and I've created
services and architectures that run on containers somewhere in a
cloud datacenter.

It's been a long road since that old BASIC loop. Still, there's
always something more to learn, and something else to create.
